## Docker images

### Typescript

Build three different typescript images based on NODE version (12, 14, 16).
Comes with pre-built dependencies that we normally need / use. Includes Sonar, Dependency-check, Docker, etc.

It uses AWS's Docker image as a base image so it's compatible with respective AWS Lambda Node Runtimes.
